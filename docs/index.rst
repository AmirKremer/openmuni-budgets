Open Budget: A platform for accessible and meaningful budgetary data
====================================================================

The Open Budget project is a web app and API for the storage, access, and manipulation of budgetary data. It is written in Python and JavaScript, using frameworks and libraries such as Django, D3, Uijet, and Jquery.

Open Budget is especially useful for comparing budgets and actuals over time, and across related entities.

V1 of Open Budget has been designed as a platform for the budgets  of municipality governments in Israel, but has been designed to be generic enough to apply to other contexts.

Open Budget is open source software and licensed under a BSD license.

Open Budget is a project of HaSadna (the Public Knowledge Workshop), a non-profit organization in Israel dedicated to transparency in government. Find out more here:
