Git branching


Branching
---------

We follow GitFlow_ for branch management.

.. _GitFlow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

What this means:

* Master branch is for production deployment only - you should not ever be working off it
* Develop branch is for work. Either work directly from it, or, preferably, branch off it into a "feature" branch
* A feature branch is named "feature/[YOUR_FEATURE_NAME]". Pull requests on themed branches like this are nice.

Examples:

* I want to work on a ticket to add "bookmarking" features, then I branch off "develop" into "feature/bookmarks", and when I am finished, I submit a pull request for this branch

* I want to work on a ticket to refactor view logic in the "entities" app, then I branch off "develop" into "feature/entities-refactoring", and when I am finished, I submit a pull request for this branch

Again, see the original post about Git Flow for more good practices:

Some GUI version control apps, such as Source Tree for OS X, integrate Git Flow into the app, making it even easier to follow the principles.
